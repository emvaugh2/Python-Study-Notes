Project 1 - Block Letters

We basically created our first and last initials using ASCII art in block letters. It was pretty straight forward. I used a triple quotation to just put in my initials with a 5 x 7 chart. I'll paste the code here for reuse later.

Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.

SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written â€” punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.

A way to print out a string and then the value of your variable is to do `print("Here's my variable value ->", <variable-name>`. 

Python converts all ints to floats before performing division

You represent exponents by doing two asterisks. So 2 to the 4th power or 2^4 would be `2 ** 4` in Python. 

You can also use `%` to divide in Python but it will give you the remainder of the division operation. So `38 % 6` would yield `2` because 6 goes into 36 6 times and what's left over is 2. 

I created an if-else loop for this problem. Might of been overkill but I'm not exactly sure what they were looking for. 

String concatenation - combining two strings together. Use `str(#)` to make a number a string. Just insert your number or variable that is an integer. 

You can use the `=+` operator to update a currently existing value. You can also use this to add additional string values to a variable. I could see this being useful. 

You can create multi-line strings by using the triple `'` or `"` quotation marks. So you would have a variable and on the other side of the equal sign, put """ and then press enter. Paste your multi-line variable here and press enter again. Then, ende it with """ again. When you print the variable, it will print your paragraph.
